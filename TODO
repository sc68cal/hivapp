	* http://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/FullHistory ?
* Remove lowest & higest from patient, those should be calculated fields
* Change "Name" to "Patient ID"
* Alert the user when lowest & highest cd4 and viral change, as they add
new visit data
* Make CD4 and DSG fields calculated values based on visit data
* Calculate patient's days since previous visit
* Figure out where to present that data
* Calculate patient's months since previous visit
* Figure out where to present that data
* Months between lowest CD4 and PBMC collection.
* Months between current CD4 and PBMC
* Months between highest viral load and PBMC collection

* also need these records updated with a place that shows
  whether a PCR product sequence has been obtained and SNPs called.

* Special case: If it is the first visit for a patient, create a "Past ART" and
  "Past CD4 and DSG" to reflect data that is coming from historic sources.
