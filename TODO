OPEN ISSUES:
*	Replicate Case Report Form

*	Patient demographics:
		Gender
		Race
		Age
		Years seropositive
		Route of infection
		HAART status - continuous (cH), discontinuous (dH), or na√Øve (nH)
		Drug test results - positive, negative, undetermined (UD)
		Number of drugs used - taken from column drugs use-admit or test
			positive.  To make this automated we will need to add
			the checked boxes from the admitted drugs with the test
			positive for with filtering out overlap.
			Not sure how you want that done on your end.
		Drugs used - break down of percent of patients that admit or
			test positive for a given drug.
		Alcohol abuse - past, current, never
		Tobacco use - past, current, never
		Avg current CD4 count
		Avg lowest CD4 count
		Avg current viral load
		Avg highest viral load

*	Revision history - who changed it and what changed?
	Initial solution - use Django Reversion
	http://code.google.com/p/django-reversion

* 	Before allowing update/create, change views so they require a review&
	confirm step

* 	Remove lowest & higest from patient, those should be calculated fields

*	Alert the user when lowest & highest cd4 and viral change, as they add
	new visit data

*	Make CD4 and DSG fields calculated values based on visit data

*	Calculate patient's days since previous visit

*	Figure out where to present that data

*	Calculate patient's months since previous visit

*	Figure out where to present that data

*	Months between lowest CD4 and PBMC collection.

*	Months between current CD4 and PBMC

*	Months between highest viral load and PBMC collection

*	Months between current viral load and PBMC collection

*	also need these records updated with a place that shows
 	whether a PCR product sequence has been obtained and SNPs called.

*	Import PCR data from excel.

*	Special case: If it is the first visit for a patient, create a "Past ART" and
	"Past CD4 and DSG" to reflect data that is coming from historic sources.

*	Break up application into smaller pieces.
