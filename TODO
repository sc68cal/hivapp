OPEN ISSUES:
*	Race dialog overwrites the race from the database since it is not part
	of the CHOICES tuple in the form.

*	AttributeError at /visit/edit/10/
	Cannot set values on a ManyToManyField which specifies an intermediary model.
	Use DrugUsed's Manager instead.

	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/387686

*	Revision history - who changed it and what changed?
	Initial solution - use Django Reversion
	http://code.google.com/p/django-reversion

*	Rework VisitForm to conform to the "Case Report Form" artifact that
	was given out by Drexel staff.

* 	Remove lowest & higest from patient, those should be calculated fields

*	Change "Name" to "Patient ID"

*	Alert the user when lowest & highest cd4 and viral change, as they add
	new visit data

*	Make CD4 and DSG fields calculated values based on visit data

*	Calculate patient's days since previous visit

*	Figure out where to present that data

*	Calculate patient's months since previous visit

*	Figure out where to present that data

*	Months between lowest CD4 and PBMC collection.

*	Months between current CD4 and PBMC

*	Months between highest viral load and PBMC collection

*	Months between current viral load and PBMC collection

*	also need these records updated with a place that shows
 	whether a PCR product sequence has been obtained and SNPs called.

*	Import PCR data from excel.

*	Special case: If it is the first visit for a patient, create a "Past ART" and
	"Past CD4 and DSG" to reflect data that is coming from historic sources.
